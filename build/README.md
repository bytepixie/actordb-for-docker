## What is ActorDB?
[ActorDB](http://www.actordb.com) is a ...

"Distributed SQL database with linear scalability.

ActorDB is strongly consistent, distributed and horizontally scalable.

Based on an industry-proven reliable database engine."

Please visit the [ActorDB project's site](http://www.actordb.com) for a full run-down and [documentation](http://www.actordb.com/docs-about.html).

## Usage
You can use this image to start up an ActorDB node. You'll want to specify a host volume for where the data should be persisted between runs, and ports to connect to.

    $ docker run -d -v /opt/actordb/data:/var/lib/actordb -p 33306:33306 -p 33307:33307 --name actordb bytepixie/actordb

The above starts up ActorDB in detached mode, with data stored locally in `/opt/actordb/data`, and ports 33306 and 33307 made available locally. It'll use the default `app.config` and `vm.args` [installed by the .deb package](https://github.com/biokoda/actordb/tree/master/etc).

You can also use the example schema setup to have a play...

    $ docker exec -it actordb actordb_console -f /etc/actordb/init.example.sql
    Config updated.
    Config updated.
    Schema updated.

... and then run some of the examples from the [Get Started doc](http://www.actordb.com/docs-getstarted.html)...

    $ docker exec -it actordb actordb_console -u myuser -pw mypass

## Configuration
### Ports
By default the image exposes two ports:

* 33306: Thrift client interface.
* 33307: MySQL client interface.

### Volumes
By default the image exposes three volumes:

* /var/lib/actordb: Data files.
* /etc/actordb: Configuration files.
* /var/log/actordb: Log files.

### User
The default user is root, but the actordb process runs as an "actordb" user.

## ActorDB Configuration Notes
Some things to remember when configuring ActorDB.

Each node you bring up *must* have a unique `-name` in its vm.args file. This means the part *before* the "@".

When using Docker, you can use the `--name` you give the container after the "@" in the `-name` setting of vm.args.
When using Docker Compose, you can use the service name after the "@" in the `-name` setting of vm.args.

You *must* remember to add each node that makes up a cluster into the nodes table. In the example `init.example.sql` it only inserts the current node's name, but you'll want to add the others.

    use config
    insert into groups values ('grp1','cluster')
    -- localnode() is whatever is in vm.args (-name ....) for node we are connected to.
    insert into nodes values (localnode(),'grp1')
    insert into nodes values ('node2@actordb-server-2','grp1')
    insert into nodes values ('node3@actordb-server-3','grp1')
    CREATE USER 'root' IDENTIFIED BY 'rootpass'
    commit

The above is taken from an [updated `init.example.sql`](https://github.com/bytepixie/actordb-for-docker/blob/master/node1/etc/init.example.sql) that is used for a very simple (and not very good) [example Docker Compose setup](https://github.com/bytepixie/actordb-for-docker/blob/master/docker-compose.yml).
